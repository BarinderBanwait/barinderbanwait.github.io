## Tabla

I am a student of [tabla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla). I keep a regular practice, often accompany shabads in Gurbani Kirtan, and occassionally play in the khayal North Indian classical style, accompanying instruments such as sitar, bansuri, and sarod.

If you play in any of these styles, or would like me to play at your event, then feel free to contact me.

Since I do not entirely ascribe to the [Guru-shishya parampara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru-shishya_tradition), and as a result of having lived in many different places over the years, I have acquired a list of teachers, as opposed to only one.

I have learned primarily Delhi and Farrukhabad styles, from the following Gurus and teachers: Pandit Udit Pankhania, [Pandit Yogesh Samsi](https://www.yogeshsamsi.com/), [Pandit Parimal Chakrabarty](https://www.parimalchakrabarty.com/), [Pandit Nayan Ghosh](https://www.nayanghosh.in/), [Pandit Prabhu Edouard](https://www.prabhuedouard.com/), [Pandit Satyajit Talwalkar](https://satyajittalwalkar.com/) [Ustad Harkirat Rayatt](https://chakardar.com/), [Ustad Gurdain Rayatt](https://gurdain.com/), and [Pandit Anup Joshi](https://www.facebook.com/TablaClass/).

I have also learned some of the vast repertoire of material from the Benaras and Punjab Gharanas, through [Ustad Surdarshan Singh Chana](https://www.festivaloftabla.com/team/surdarshan-chana).

My deepest respects to these Gurus and teachers who have shown me this fascinating world where numbers, harmony, and poetry all merge into one artform :pray:
