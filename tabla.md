## Tabla

I am a student of [tabla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla). I keep a regular practice, often accompany shabads in Gurbani Kirtan, and occassionally play in the khayal North Indian classical style, accompanying instruments such as sitar, bansuri, and sarod. Here are some links to past concerts:

* [Bhairavi, July 6th 2023, Lilypad, Cambridge MA](https://youtu.be/5gadjdyI4ng)
* [Short Tabla solo, July 6th 2023, Lilypad, Cambridge MA](https://youtu.be/3x6Op8Q_qCE)
* [Vachaspati, July 6th 2023, Lilypad, Cambridge MA](https://youtu.be/POjJ7tobltk)
* [Miyan ki Malhar, July 6th 2023, Lilypad, Cambridge MA](https://youtu.be/d-xbP5vsFMk)
* [House concert, May 25th 2023, Brookline MA](https://youtu.be/3wrNHN6hAK4)

Since I do not entirely ascribe to the [Guru-shishya parampara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru-shishya_tradition), and as a result of having lived in many different places over the years, I have acquired a list of teachers, as opposed to only one.

I have learned primarily Delhi and Farrukhabad styles, from the following Gurus and teachers: Pandit Udit Pankhania, [Pandit Yogesh Samsi](https://www.yogeshsamsi.com/), [Pandit Parimal Chakrabarty](https://www.parimalchakrabarty.com/), [Pandit Nayan Ghosh](https://www.nayanghosh.in/), [Pandit Prabhu Edouard](https://www.prabhuedouard.com/), [Satyajit Talwalkar](https://satyajittalwalkar.com/), [Ustad Harkirat Rayatt](https://chakardar.com/), [Gurdain Rayatt](https://gurdain.com/), and [Anup Joshi](https://www.facebook.com/TablaClass/).

I have also learned some of the vast repertoire of material from the Benaras and Punjab Gharanas, through [Ustad Surdarshan Singh Chana](https://www.festivaloftabla.com/team/surdarshan-chana).

My deepest respects to these Gurus and teachers who have shown me this fascinating world where numbers, harmony, and poetry all merge into one artform :pray:
