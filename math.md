## Mathematics

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in [Jennifer Balakrishnan's]() group at Boston University. My research is funded by the [Simons Foundation]().

I work in Number Theory and Arithmetic Geometry, with a computational approach. Most of my research projects have included at least one of [Sage](), [Magma](), and [PARI/GP](), and some have used all three.

I also contribute to development of the [_L-functions and modular forms database_]().
