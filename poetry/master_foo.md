# Master Fu and the sparkling water

## 為了左牛拙 :)

Once upon a time Master Fu was travelling to the distant realm of Notsob, whereupon arriving at the city gates he entered the imperial court of Yllaw, and, being seated at the throne of the lost king of Dunhuang, did command a bottle of sparkling water. Musicians from the temple of Sizhukong were in the rapture of a lively musical improvisation. 

A novice scholar, beholding this spectacle, did timidly approach the master from behind.

"Master, why does a venerable adept such as yourself order but a simple bottle of sparkling water?"

The master instructed the novice:

"Before enlightenment, I chopped wood and ordered sparkling water. After enlightenment, I chopped wood and ordered sparkling water."

The novice was confused, but dared not disturb the master's appreciation of the live music.

After a long period of searching for the necessary courage, the novice asked:

"Master, it has been observed that you do on occasion enjoy the fine Japanese whiskeys from the Suntory distillery?"

The master nodded in agreement.

"And it has also been observed that you partake of the Sea smoke Pinot noir while feasting on the rare farro pasta from the Northern regions?"

The master nodded in agreement.

"Why then, o master, do you not, in such surroundings as these, with fine music and ambience and gaiety, also indulge in such beverages?"

The master spoke:

"A good heart is like sparkling water."

Upon hearing these words, the novice was enlightened.
